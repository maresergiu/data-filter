The application has the following structure:
- a form that is made out of two fieldsets.
  The first one has an input type text and a search CTA.
  The second fieldset holds the filter. The filter offers the possibility the filter the data by  age, eyeColor ,gender ,prefered animals
  and prefered fruit.
  The form triggers a validation when the search CTA is clicked. The validation is triggered only on the first fieldset.
  The emitted data from both fieldset are stored when the user interacts with the inputs and are used to filter the data.

- a list of users that behaves like an accordion. When a list element is selected the data related that user is shown in a slide animation.
  The list of users is going to be reactive to the filters.

- a pagination that is showing the current page. The pagination is responsible of showing and changing the page. When the page is changing
  the data is changed as well. The pagination is going to be reactive based on the user array.
  If page number 1 is active the first page cta is disabled.
  If the last page is active the last  page cta is disabled.
